RELEASE 1.0.0.2
----------------------------------

LaTeX and HTML output fixes:

- Fixed a bug where minimum reps/second and minimum reps/second would report as
zero.
- Fixed a bug where minimum and maximum reps/second were swapped.
- Fixed a bug where, if the time taken to do all trials was less than a second,
the program would attempt to divide by zero and no file would be written out.
This has been fixed by checking to see if it was equal to approximately zero
first, then, if the experiment end condition was an amount of repetitions,
use the value for decimal.MaxValue. If it was a pattern, it uses Positive
Infinity instead.


LaTeX specific fixes:

- Fixed an issue where the text for the name prompt wouldn't appear
to have two lines when it should.


Pattern End Condition fixes:

- Multi-threading is now disabled, as additional threads will incorrectly
inflate the total rep count.
- Although indexing is still a bit odd in the End Condition Chooser;
you can now remove the zeroth index item on the list without any problems.
